Lectures were/BED really good ./. There were/BED lot of/IN people who/WPS came their/PP$ without any/DTI Java knowledge and/CC yet you were/BED very supportive ./. 5/5 for/IN me ./. It/PPS 's really good that/CS the/AT lecturer explains most of/IN the/AT concepts using examples ./. It/PPS helps us to/TO understand them/PPO better ./. But/CC if you are/BER sitting at/IN the/AT back ,/, you ca n't properly see what/WDT 's on/IN the/AT board because the/AT board is/BEZ too small and/CC the/AT lecturer writes in/IN small letters due to/TO that/CS ./. On general lectures are/BER understandable and/CC good ./. All the/AT 7 lectures were/BED clearly explained and/CC had/HVD a/AT good content also/RB ./.

Very easy to/TO understand because the/AT teaching method is/BEZ great ./. When i came to/TO the/AT first/OD lecture i did n't know anything about/IN OOP but/CC now i know something without even putting an/AT extra effort ./. Discussing a/AT question using java everyday is/BEZ very helpful to/TO keep track of/IN our mistakes and/CC to/TO improve ourselves ./. Finally I/PPSS take this/DT time/NN thank you ,/, so thank you very much madam for/IN your support ./. In/IN first/OD time/NN I/PPSS do the/AT java ,/, the/AT lectures help me to/TO set a/AT foundation for/IN java ./. I/PPSS feel the/AT lectures are/BER help me a/AT lot ./. The/AT lecturer 's teaching method is/BEZ so good ./. She explained the/AT lessons very well and/CC asked questions in/IN the/AT class ./. In/IN my opinion ,/, the/AT lecture will/MD be/BE more/AP effective for/IN us if she explain the/AT examples little slower ./. They were/BED well structured and/CC I/PPSS were/BED able to/TO learn fundamental concepts of/IN oop ./. I/PPSS did n't know anything about/IN java early but/CC now I/PPSS adequate to/TO learn more/AP and/CC code in/IN java since I/PPSS got the/AT basic principals of/IN java ./. I/PPSS could/MD understand the/AT concepts well because of/IN lecture slides and/CC in/IN class activities were/BED well arranged as/CS well as/CS punctual ./. Recap segment was/BEDZ also/RB very useful and/CC helpful to/TO memories the/AT previous lecture as/CS well ./. i came to/TO cse without any/DTI knowledge of/IN oop or/CC jawa ./. now i learn quite aout oop ./. slides and/CC inclass test are/BER good ./. there/EX were/BED good explanations I/PPSS understood OOP concepts very well ./. lectures were/BED so good ./.

I/PPSS think it/PPS will/MD really helpful if there/EX are/BER more/AP examples were/BED discussed during the/AT lecture ./. Teaches with/IN good examples and/CC easy to/TO understand ./. Thank you ! During last/AP 7 weeks this/DT module was/BEDZ my favorite and/CC i really got big idea about/IN oop concepts as/CS well as/CS java programming ./. Asking question during the/AT lecture was/BEDZ very helpful to/TO us ./. I/PPSS am very happy if Madam continue this/DT teaching style in/IN rest of/IN our semester ./. Starting from/IN the/AT very first/OD lecture ,/, object oriented programming concepts were/BED introduced using real life incidents ./. So I/PPSS could/MD assure this/DT lecture series would/MD be/BE more/AP interesting to/TO study ./. Had a/AT good interaction with/IN students and/CC encouraged students to/TO ask questions ./. In/IN class activities were/BED useful to/TO understand the/AT programming concepts ./. As a/AT suggestion ,/, it/PPS will/MD be/BE a/AT good idea if the/AT department gives a/AT brief idea about/IN OOP in/IN the/AT semester 1 field familiarization program ./. So the/AT students who/WPS are/BER willing to/TO come to/TO CSE department can/MD practice on/IN some/DTI programming languages before/IN coming to/TO the/AT department ./. Lectures are/BER very clear and/CC helpful to/TO understand oop basic principles ./. Lecture slides are/BER well arangend and/CC adequate examples are/BER discussed during the/AT lecture ./.

You always motivate us to/TO working on/IN this/DT subject and/CC ask questions ./. Thank You for/IN being a/AT good lecturer ./. At the/AT start some/DTI of/IN us struggled to/TO pick up/RP in/IN the/AT class because we/PPSS did n't study java then ./. I/PPSS think it/PPS was/BEDZ n't a/AT fault of/IN lecturer ./. Other than/IN that/CS there/EX were/BED no/AT problems I/PPSS really appreciate the/AT teaching style of/IN the/AT lecturer ./. Keeping interactions with/IN students ,/, asking questions ,/, giving in/IN class activities and/CC discussing them/PPO within the/AT class were/BED greatly helpful for/IN me to/TO develop my oop skills.As well it/PPS is/BEZ very easy to/TO concentrate on/IN the/AT lesson through out/RP the/AT class because of/IN the/AT interesting way of/IN teaching ./. Your teaching style helped me to/TO understand basic principles of/IN OOP cocepts ./. I/PPSS think you taught that/CS very well ./. Learning environment was/BEDZ good ./. It/PPS would/MD be/BE better if you can/MD explain the/AT principles by/IN counter examples ./. (/( by/IN using code parts )/) Overall the/AT class was/BEDZ good and/CC interesting ./. Making us construct codes in/IN the/AT class was/BEDZ good as/CS we/PPSS could/MD check to/TO how much extent we/PPSS had/HVD learnt the/AT concepts properly ./. Concepts were/BED taught well ./. If more/AP examples could/MD be/BE explained for/IN each section it/PPS would/MD have/HV been/BEN better ./. you are/BER teaching verywell madam I/PPSS almost understood everything what/WDT you have/HV been/BEN teaching in/IN previous 7 lectures ./. got the/AT ideas of/IN the/AT topics discussed ./. well managed lectures ./.

I/PPSS think i learned a/AT lot from/IN the/AT codes you write in/IN the/AT board ./. When i compare my codes with/IN yours i can/MD learn about/IN my mistakes and/CC good coding practices that/CS i should follow ./. There fore i think it/PPS would/MD be/BE great if we/PPSS can/MD discuss more/AP examples in/IN the/AT class ./. madam explained the/AT oop concepts clearly with/IN examples.lectures were/BED interesting.we want more/AP scenario examples and/CC answers with/IN explanations in/IN future ./.

Ms. Surangika encouraged us to/TO ask questions if there/EX 's any/DTI doubt and/CC proceeded with/IN the/AT lectures in/IN a/AT more/AP interactive manner ./. The/AT lecture slides were/BED uploaded to/TO the/AT moodle every week/NN ./.

It/PPS may cause some/DTI ambiguity ./. lectures were/BED good ./. Lectures were/BED good ! Well structured ! Able to/TO get clear understanding on/IN the/AT topic as/CS lectures were/BED gradually developed.In my opinion the/AT lectures were/BED well constructed and/CC recommended good ./. Good.The lecture slides were/BED well prepared with/IN appropriate examples.I was/BEDZ able to/TO understand the/AT basic concepts well ./.
